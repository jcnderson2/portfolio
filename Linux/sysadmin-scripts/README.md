## SysAdmin Scripts

### Contents
    
1. health-check.sh - I wrote this as a quick and dirty system health check for linux users and occasionally servers. Its a toolbox tool in screenconnect making it very easy to run when remoted in or have ran in the background and then read from screenconnect backstage
    
2. log-analyzer.sh - I wrote this to analyze SSH login attempts by parsing '/var/log/auth.log' to see failed logins, top 5 IPs with failed logins, and recent sudo usage
