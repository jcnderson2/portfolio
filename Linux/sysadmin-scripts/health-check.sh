# It outputs basic statistic information from the system its ran on to '/var/logs/health-check-DATEANDTIME.log'

# Why this was made:
# Uploading this to our tenants' screenconnect toolbox simply allows us to get this information quicker when troubleshooting linux machines which are not always servers.
