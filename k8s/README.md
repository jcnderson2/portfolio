# Kubernetes basics project using NGINX
I wanted to make a kubernetes project to showcase my basic working knowledge of kubernetes(with a little extra functionality) now that I have finished a beginners course.

## What this does
- Uses minikube for a local kubenetes cluster
- Deploys NGINX with a custom HTML page and health check endpoint
